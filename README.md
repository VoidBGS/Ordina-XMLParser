# Ordina-XMLParser
Custom file parser made for extracting data from weird XML files. Made in Visual Studio using XmlReader in C#.

## Developer Note
This file parser will not work on any other XML files except the ones given to us by Ordina. It is ***very specific*** to the usecase we currently have.
